The experiment is made based on IOT â€“ use pin D2-D53 of the Arduino board to control an LED. When these digital is programmed to output high level, 
the LED will be turned on.
Next, delay for some time. Then these digitals pins is programmed to output low level to turn the LED off. Repeat the above process and you can get a blinking LED then.
